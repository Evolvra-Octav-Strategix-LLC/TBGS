Goal:
Create two reusable, high-end SEO page templates that maximize organic ranking + Google Business Profile (GBP) visibility + Local Pack performance for TBGS B.V.

1. Dienst × Locatie Template

For pages like:

/nl/eindhoven/daklekkage

/nl/nuenen/renovatie

/be/lommel/onderhoud

Requirements:

SEO-optimized structure with proper <title>, <meta description>, <h1>, <h2>.

Strong intro paragraph with “Dienst + Stad” immediately included.

Service explanation (what it is, common problems, TBGS solutions).

Local trust signals: mention the city, nearby areas, and “TBGS in [Stad]”.

Project showcase section (with before/after photos or case examples).

Benefits/USP block (fast service, warranty, 25+ years experience).

FAQ block with schema.org markup (service + city specific questions).

Call-to-Action blocks (sticky phone button, free quote form).

Google Maps embed of TBGS location for GBP authority.

Structured data (JSON-LD): Service + LocalBusiness + FAQ.

Internal links: back to

main service page (/nl/daklekkage)

city hub page (/nl/eindhoven)

2. Locatie Hub Template

For pages like:

/nl/eindhoven

/be/lommel

Requirements:

H1: “TBGS in [Stad] – Dak, Schoorsteen, Onderhoud & Bouw”.

Intro paragraph highlighting TBGS’ role in the city.

Service overview block → links to Dienst × Locatie pages (Daklekkage Eindhoven, Renovatie Eindhoven, etc.).

About the city section (local landmarks/areas) to strengthen geo relevance.

Reviews/testimonials from customers in that city (with schema).

Project showcase (local).

FAQ about services in that city.

Google Maps embed of TBGS location.

Structured data (JSON-LD): LocalBusiness + FAQ.

Internal links back to homepage, service hubs, nearby city pages.

If user visits /eindhoven without /nl/, auto-redirect (301) → /nl/eindhoven.

General SEO Rules (apply to both templates):

Title tag: [Dienst] in [Stad] | TBGS – Totaal Bouw Groep Specialisten

Meta description: short, includes service + city + CTA.

H1: always [Dienst] in [Stad] or TBGS in [Stad].

Content length: 900–1200 words minimum.

Keyword density: Dienst + Stad in first 100 words, then naturally 6–8x.

Media: at least 3 optimized images (with alt="Dienst [Stad]").

Schema Markup: LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, Review.

NAP consistency: identical address/phone as GBP footer.

Maps embed: always include official GBP location.

Final Output Expectation

Each template should produce:

Full HTML page skeleton (ready for Next.js/React integration).

Example content placeholders ([Dienst], [Stad], [Nearby areas]).

Schema.org JSON-LD blocks for LocalBusiness + Service + FAQ.

Internal linking structure.

SEO-ready to copy-paste and adapt for each city/service.
